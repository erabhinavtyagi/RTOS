 * void vTaskDelete( TaskHandle_t pxTask ); 
 * 
 * It will delete an instance of a task that was previously created using a call to 
 * xTaskCreate() or xTaskCreateStatic().
 * 
 * When a task is deleted, it is the responsibility of the idle task to free the memory 
 * that had been used to hold the deleted taskâ€™s stack and data structures (task control block).
 * Therefore, if an application makes use of the vTaskDelete() API function, it is vital that
 * the application also ensures the idle task is not starved of processing time 
 * (the idle task must be allocated time in the Running state).
